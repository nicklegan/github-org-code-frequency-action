# GitHub Organization Code Frequency Action

> A GitHub Action to generate a report that contains code frequency metrics and programming languages used per repository belonging to a GitHub organization.

## Usage

The example [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) below runs on a monthly [schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) using the amount of weeks as an interval set in `action.yml` (default 4 weeks) and can also be triggered manually using a [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#manual-events) event.

```yml
name: Code Frequency Action

on:
  schedule:
    # Runs on the first day of the month at 00:00 UTC
    #
    #        ┌────────────── minute
    #        │ ┌──────────── hour
    #        │ │ ┌────────── day (month)
    #        │ │ │ ┌──────── month
    #        │ │ │ │ ┌────── day (week)
    - cron: '0 0 1 * *'

| `weeks`           | Amount of weeks in the past to collect data for **(weeks start on Sunday 00:00:00 GMT)** | `4`                         |                                                                                          | `false`  |

## Workflow dispatch inputs

The additional option to retrieve code frequency data using a custom date interval.
If the below fields are left empty during [workflow dispatch input](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/), the default interval option of set weeks from the current date configured in `main.yml` will be used instead.

:bulb: The result data includes the weeks which have their start date **(Sunday 00:00:00 GMT)** within the set interval.

| Name                           | Value                                   | Required |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `Optional interval start date` | A date matching the format `yyyy-mm-dd` | `false`  |
| `Optional interval end date`   | A date matching the format `yyyy-mm-dd` | `false`  |

## CSV layout

The results of the 2nd and 3rd report column will be the sum of code frequency date for the selected interval per organization repository.

| Column                   | Description                                         |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Repository               | Organization owned repository                       |
| Lines added (interval)   | Number of lines of code added during set interval   |
| Lines deleted (interval) | Number of lines of code deleted during set interval |
| All time lines added     | Number of lines of code added since repo creation   |
| All time lines deleted   | Number of lines of code deleted since repo creation |
| Primary language         | The primary programming language used in the repo   |
| All languages            | All programming languages used in the repo          |
| Repo creation date       | Date the repo has been created                      |

A CSV report file to be saved in the repository `reports` folder using the following naming format: `organization-date-interval.csv`.

## GitHub App authentication

In some scenarios it might be preferred to authenthicate as a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps) rather than using a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

The following features could be a benefit authenticating as a GitHub App installation:

- The GitHub App is directly installed on the organization, no separate user account is required.
- A GitHub App has more granular permissions than a personal access token.
- To avoid hitting the 5000 requests per hour GitHub API rate limit, [authenticating as a GitHub App installation](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#authenticating-as-an-installation) would increase the [API request limit](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/building-github-apps/rate-limits-for-github-apps#github-enterprise-cloud-server-to-server-rate-limits).

The GitHub App authentication strategy can be integrated with the Octokit library by installing and configuring the [@octokit/auth-app](https://github.com/octokit/auth-app.js/#usage-with-octokit) npm module before [rebuilding](https://docs.github.com/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action) the Action in a separate repository.
